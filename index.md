Hello, I am an independent consultant in data science and visualization.

I operate on the research activities within private and public
institutions, giving support to the visualization of patterns emerging
from complex phenomena and to the interaction with highly organized
datasets.

My approach to the data visualization has its roots on the crossroad
between the abstract mathematical thinking and the guidelines drawn by
the semiotic of graphics. I therefore offer a peculiar expertise on the
creation of expressive graphical representations of complex scenarios.
