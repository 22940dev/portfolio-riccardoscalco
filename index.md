*Riccardo Scalco is an independent consultant in graphic information
processing and data science.*

I operate on the research activities within private and public
institutions, giving support to the visualization of patterns emerging
from complex phenomena and to the creation of expressive graphical representations of big datasets.

# Independent Projects

*[Pykov](https://github.com/riccardoscalco/Pykov)* - Python
module on finite regular Markov chains.
