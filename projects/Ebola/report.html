<p>September/October 2014 <br>
Authors: Riccardo Scalco, Sergio Cima <br>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> <br>
We researched a method to define the most referential twitter users on a specific topic, the following report describes the applied methodology and the results achieved. <br>
(The report is under development)</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="data-retrieval">Data Retrieval</h2>

<p>Data has been retrieved from Twitter, connecting to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">twitter public streaming endpoint</a> with the following request parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>keywords tracked:</strong> <code>ebola, mers, antivirals, bigpharma antivirals, bigpharma pandemic flu, bird flu, H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, infectious outbreak, oseltamivir, pandemic, pandemic flu, pandemic vaccine, relenza, tamiflu, zanamivir, vaccine, vaccines, vaccinated, vaccinates, vaccinate, vaccination, vaccinations</code></li>
<li><strong>languages</strong>: <code>it, en, fr, de, es</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From the returned <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets">tweet objects</a>, we selected and stored the following informations relative to each Tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>lang</code>: The machine-detected language of the Tweet text.</li>
<li><code>text</code>: The actual UTF-8 text.</li>
<li><code>created_at</code>: UTC time when this Tweet was created.</li>
<li><code>id_str</code>: The string representation of the unique identifier for this Tweet.</li>
<li><code>coordinates:</code> Th geographic location of this Tweet as reported by the user or client application. </li>
<li><code>user</code>: The user id of the user who posted this Tweet.</li>
<li><code>username</code>: The username of the user who posted this Tweet.</li>
<li><code>rtOf</code>: If this Twet is a RT, the string representation of the unique identifier of the original tweet.</li>
<li><code>rtFrom</code>: If this Twet is a RT, the user id of the user who posted he original tweet.</li>
<li><code>user_mentions</code>: List of other Twitter users mentioned in the text of the Tweet.</li>
<li><code>hashtags</code>: List of hashtags which have been parsed out of the Tweet text.</li>
<li><code>urls</code>: List of URLs included in the Tweet text.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> we collected <strong>6.786.843</strong> tweets, of which <strong>3.739.603</strong> are retweets and <strong>4.580.781</strong> contain at least one user mention.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="mathematical-methods">Mathematical Methods</h2>



<h4 id="rules">Definition of the Network</h4>

<p>As described above, the raw data retrieved from the streaming is a list of objects, each one containing information relative to a single tweet. From such data structure we derived a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29">weighted directed graph</a> by means of the following assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>graph nodes are twitter users and graph edges are links between twitter users</li>
<li>if user <em>a</em> retweets user <em>b</em> then a directed link <em>(a,b)</em> is created</li>
<li>if user <em>a</em> mentions user <em>b</em> then a directed link <em>(a,b)</em> is created</li>
<li>each link <em>(a,b)</em> is weighted by the number of times it is found on the data, i.e. by the number of times user <em>a</em> retweets or mentions user <em>b</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, let say the user @NigeriaNewsdesk writes the tweet <em>“EBOLA: Nigerian students face multiple screening at Ontario college <a href="http://t.co/Ko0p1v685J">http://t.co/Ko0p1v685J</a> via @todayngr”</em>, then the link <em>(NigeriaNewsdesk,todayngr)</em> is created because of the mention. <br>
If the same tweet is then retweeted by user @RoYnuElz, the links <em>(RoYnuElz,NigeriaNewsdesk)</em> and <em>(RoYnuElz,todayngr)</em> are created, the first because of the retweet, the second because of the mention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above rules have the target to highlight the user visibility on the discussion, in fact any link born from an event that make a user visible to others. In other words, moving on the network form node to node and following the links with highest weight, we have the possibility to discover the most visible users on a certain topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, note that we did not consider the number of user’s followers at all on the definition of the network. <br>
We instead preferred to focus on events that clearly determine a <em>connection among users that is also visible to other users</em>, like mentions and retweets.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> after applying the above rules to the dataset of tweets, the resulting direct graph has <strong>2.485.254</strong> nodes and <strong>4.732.079</strong> edges, with a ratio edges/nodes of <strong>1.9</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="strongly-connected-components">Strongly connected components</h4>

<p>The directed graph created with the <a href="#rules">previous described rules</a> results to be disconnected, as expected. <br>
The lack of connectivity is a trivial consequence of the fact that each link is created independently from the others, and therefore there is no way to expect the existence of a connecting path for any couple of nodes.</p>

<p>Vice versa, a directed graph is <em>strongly connected</em> if it contains a directed path from node <em>a</em> to node <em>b</em> and a directed path from node <em>b</em> to node <em>a</em> for every pair of nodes <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>. Many useful algorithms and interesting properties, in particular the ones that we will discuss later, are computables only on strongly connected graphs.</p>

<p>As first operation on the graph, we extract its strongly connected components. <br>
One component has much more nodes than all the others, we decide to focus on it for further analysis and, later on, we refer to it as graph <em>G</em>.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> graph <em>G</em> results to have <strong>82.953</strong> nodes and <strong>593.685</strong> edges, with a ratio edges/nodes of <strong>7.2</strong>. The second largest component has only 30 nodes.</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="further-reduction-of-the-network-size">Further reduction of the network size</h4>

<p>In order to reduce the computational effort, it is convenient to reduce the size of <em>G</em>. We achieved the target progressively removing nodes until <em>every node in G has at least 10 in-going links</em>, as expressed by the following <em>pseudo-code</em>:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint" data-initialized="true" data-gclp-id="2"><code class=" hljs sql">  <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">all</span> nodes <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> G <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> less than <span class="hljs-number">10</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>-going links
  repeat
    remove the selected nodes <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> G <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">update</span> G
    <span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">all</span> nodes <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> G <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> less than <span class="hljs-number">10</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span>-going links
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> there <span class="hljs-keyword">are</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">no</span> more nodes <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> remove
      exit
  return the largest strongly connected component <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> G</span></code></pre>

<p>Note that the above procedure does not guarantee that some of the most probable states are not removed, although for a highly connected network this is fairly unexpected.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> after reduction, <em>G</em> has <strong>653</strong> nodes and <strong>17.381</strong> edges, with a ratio edges/nodes of <strong>26.6</strong>. The second largest component has 21 nodes.</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="markov-chain-and-the-steady-state">Markov Chain and the steady state</h4>

<p>Graph <em>G</em> is a weighted directed graph, if we replace the non-zero entries of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a> with the associated weights we obtain an integer square matrix <em>Q</em> with non negative entries that defines the network as well as graph <em>G</em>, i.e. there is no loss of information.</p>

<p>With an operation of normalization, Matrix <em>Q</em> can be transformed into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix">right stochastic matrix</a> <em>T</em> (that is possible simply dividing each entry of a row by the entries sum of that row, so that the new entries sum to one). The so formed stochastic matrix <em>T</em> define the transition matrix of a discrete-time finite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>. </p>

<p>With the assumption of aperiodicity, thanks to the strongly connectivity of graph <em>G</em> the chain <em>T</em> is ergodic, which means that for any couple of nodes there exists a path connecting them with non zero probability. Ergodic chains do not present absorbing states, and the equilibrium distribution have non zero entries.</p>

<p>The steady state <em>p</em>, i.e. the equilibrium distribution, is unique and it is defined as the eigenvector of <em>T</em> with eigenvalue equal to one: <em>p = pT</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coming back to the previous observation, where we introduced the idea of moving on the network following links according to their probability, we can ask for the probability to find ourselves in a particular node, i.e. at a particular user page, and it turns out that this probability is expressed by the steady state distribution.</p>

<p>For every user in the steady state, we are interested in evaluating the number of tweets they wrote (green line), the number of tweets retweeted by other users (red line) and the number of times they are mentioned (blue line). The image below shows the distribution of the evaluated normalized quantities among the first 150 users of the equilibrium distribution (the black line is the steady state distribution, as above).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KdDDVgUipxn1nLpIhGAcPBIvk8i7IeP7VQ24kQVQ9U4=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="steady state distribution and tweets statistics"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> The above image shows how the equilibrium distribution does not correlate with the most easily computable observables, namely the number of tweets and the number of retweets and mentions achieved. <br>
  The steady state probability distribution differs from the mentioned observables on the fact that it depends on the <em>global dynamics</em> on the network, on the other hand the observables are evaluated independently to each other and without taking into account connections among users.</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="bc">Betweenness centrality</h4>

<p>The calculation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality">betweenness centrality</a> property of a node <em>a</em> in <em>G</em> does not rely on the previous definitions of <em>T</em> and <em>p</em>, it is instead defined by means of the calculation of the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others that pass through node <em>a</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Betweenness centrality is effective on finding nodes that have a large influence on the connection of two or more communities on the network, where a community is a subset of nodes highly connected to each other. It is worth noting that the above interpretation is under the assumption that walkers follows shortest paths, in the cases where other paths are allowed the interpretation of the betweenness centrality is more difficult and the returned values less reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We calculated the betweenness centrality of every node in <em>G</em>, considering unweighted edges.</p>

<h4 id="ec">Eigenvector centrality</h4>

<p>Despite the similarities with the calculation of the eigenvector centrality, the resulting list of influential users is different. Egenvector centrality takes into account only the graph topology and it is more appropriate on unweighted networks.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9lb__upXLujwh6BkPfb0TcaOPGYrTdlwqtHeaYw492w=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="fig2.png"></p>

<p>The figure shows a comparison between the ranking resulted from the steady state (black) with the ranking from eigenvector (green)  and betweenness (red) centrality. In case of correlation, the green and red dots should be superimposed, or at least near, the black dots.</p>

<p>The values on x axis are the position along the ordered list of users resulting from the steady state method, the values on y axis the position along the ordered list of users resulting from the steady state method (black), betweenness centrality (red) and eigenvector centrality (green),</p>



<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The rules applied on the network definition have the target to highlight the user visibility on the discussion, we indeed  preferred to focus on events that clearly determine a connection among users that is also visible to other users.</p>

<p>Being based on mentions and retweets, the described metodology is effective also on discovering influential users on the short period, therefore it offers an analytical tool suitable for discussions on specific events along with a time variable list of influential users.</p>

<p>The influence of a user is weighted by means of the influence of the users linked to herself, therefore mentions or retweet from influential users are weighted more.</p>

<p>Despite the similarities with the calculation of the eigenvector centrality, the resulting list of influential users is different. Egenvector centrality takes into account only the graph topology and it is more appropriate on unweighted networks.</p>

<p>Eventually, the ordered list of influential users does not correlate with the absolute number of retweets or mentions achieved by the users, preventing not relevant but highly popular users to be qualified as influential.</p>

<h1 id="further-analysis">Further analysis</h1>



<h3 id="diffusion-of-new-ideas-over-the-users-network">Diffusion of new ideas over the users network</h3>

<p>This analysis has the target to answer at questions like: <em>How new ideas spread over the network of users?</em> and <em>How new ideas spread on time?</em> <br>
Given a set of pairs of words, like for example the set <em>{(ebola, isis), (ebola, terrorism)}</em>, we can study:</p>

<ul>
<li>the temporal patterns emerging from the series of tweets containing at least one of such pairs. Only original tweets are showed on the time axis, with area proportional to the number of retweets.</li>
<li>the temporal patterns emerging during the creation of the users network. It is interesting to study the time evolution of observables like the the ratio <em>edges/node</em>,  the <em>number of connected components</em> and the <em>graph entropy</em>.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<p>Every circle in the scatter plots above represents a tweet (not RT), its size is proportional to number of times it has been retweeted, and the x and y positions are the time of creation and the user metric respectively (here we used that steady state distribution as metric). <br>
In the first plot (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) are collected all the tweets containing both the words <em>ebola</em> and <em>spanish</em>, the second one (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) show instead tweets containing words <em>ebola</em> and <em>mutation</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Fig. 1</strong> <br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UZdopfvTunx4nMXvuIqIvUv_eUv-F7wlRTH_j60kHW0=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="eb-spanish.png"></p>

<p><strong>Fig. 2</strong> <br>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vwnPO-fdB5pRI7e8x9EwSX2rSKQNrr-oY8q9t4dzroQ=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="eb-mutation.png"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> note that users with higher metrics are not necessarily retweeted more that other users, moreover there are no special patterns on the time series. In these two examples it is worth noting the presence of two highly valued users just at the beginning of a cascade and, given that every tweet is not a retweets, this means that those users are among the first to express a tweet containing the couple of words under investigation in that particular cascade.</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>

<p>The figure below shows the frequency of using relevant words on topics like <em>conspiracy</em>, <em>fear</em>, <em>vaccines</em> and <em>treatment</em> in relation with the word <em>ebola</em>. Each timeseries goes from October 19 to November 12 and it indicates the amount of times the specif words appear on Twitter, with data integrated over a time step of 1 hour.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zKP-s7F0os6rA7IfnCi96n-Wohv8XGjgpfVIOuGAgG8=s0" alt="enter image description here" title="fig3pic.png"></p>

<p>Each topic is defined by a set of words and a logical relation among them. For example, <br>
<code>'ebola' AND ('bigpharma', 'falseflag')</code> means <code>('ebola' AND 'bigpharma') OR ('ebola' AND 'falseflag')</code>.</p>

<h3 id="emergence-of-new-ideas-on-the-semantic-network">Emergence of new ideas on the semantic network</h3>

<p>This analysis has the target to answer at questions like: <em>What are the most common words that act as semantic bridge between two given ideas?</em> and <em>What is the semantic path followed on the emergence of a new idea?</em> <br>
From the set of tweets, we can create an undirect graph where nodes are words and edges are link between words. Then we can study:</p>

<ul>
<li>the shortest paths between two given nodes </li>
<li>the temporal patterns underlying the emergence of a new node during the creation of the semantic graph, like the most followed paths.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="measuring-success-on-twitter">Measuring success on Twitter</h3>

<p><em>We should be tracking those things that help us determine and measure our business goals.</em></p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com">Twitter analytics</a> has been released, and a detailed overview can be found <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/introducing-organic-tweet-analytics">here</a>. Shortly, Twitter analytics looks at <em>impressions</em> and <em>engagement</em> metrics relative to a user or a single tweet, and both of them are calculated by means of  an <em>integration over twitter users</em> that interact with the account under investigation.</p>

<p>Twitter analytics does a very good job and, as consequence, any attempt to extend the measure of success has to start from quite different assumptions and computations. In this sense we do not integrate over twitter users, we prefer instead to evaluate the success of a given user looking at the network properties of the twitter users that interacted with it.</p>

<p>In other words, our approach defines metrics that strongly depends on the interacting users and it is based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>the community active on a given topic has been identified;</li>
<li>the user under investigation is <em>observable</em>, i.e. it achieved success  (interacted) with at least a member of the community (we used the term <em>observable</em> because we observe only the community);</li>
<li>a metric is a function of some network properties, which values vary from node to node, that is they depends on the interacting users.</li>
</ul>

<p>As result, every metric can be visualized as a <em>time series</em> that shows both the amount of interactions and their values in respect with the associated network properties.</p>



<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>The figure above shows an example of such analysis. We collected, over time, all the interaction events (i.e. retweets and mentions) achieved by @bcsolomon and we plotted them as a scatter plot, where the x and y positions are the event time and the metric of the interacting user respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-beaker"></i> <strong>Partial result:</strong> note how some of the massive events have at the very beginning a twitter user with a high metric value (red lines). Our assumption is that the massive events are triggered by such valuable events (a further validation of such assumption is difficult because with the present state of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets">Twitter API</a> retweets of retweets do not show representations of the intermediary retweet, but only the original tweet). <br>
  The identification of the most valuable interacting users among all is a vital feature on the understanding of twitter cascades related to the activity of a given user.</p>

<p>The following material has to be intended as first steps on further analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Fig 1:</strong> rankings based on the steady state distribution and the betweenness centrality are compared for the first 300 users on steady state. The resulting matrix is sparse, which means there is no correlation among the two rankings. <br>
